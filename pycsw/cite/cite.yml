        title: pycsw OGC CITE demo and Reference Implementation
        description: pycsw is an OARec and OGC CSW server implementation written in
            Python. pycsw fully implements the OGC API - Records and OpenGIS Catalogue
            Service Implementation Specification (Catalogue Service for the Web).
            Initial development started in 2010 (more formally announced in 2011).
            The project is certified OGC Compliant, and is an OGC Reference Implementation.
            Since 2015, pycsw is an official OSGeo Project. pycsw allows for the publishing
            and discovery of geospatial metadata via numerous APIs (CSW 2/CSW 3, OpenSearch,
            OAI-PMH, SRU). Existing repositories of geospatial metadata can also be
            exposed, providing a standards-based metadata and catalogue component
            of spatial data infrastructures. pycsw is Open Source, released under
            an MIT license, and runs on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS
            X)
